Organization.create(name: "Black Visions Collective", location: "Minnesota", website: "https://www.blackvisionsmn.org", donation_link: "https://secure.everyaction.com/4omQDAR0oUiUagTu0EG-Ig2", description: "BLVC is committed to a long term vision in which ALL Black lives not only matter, but are able to thrive. What we know to be true in order to create this world is that oppressed people, especially Black people, need to build collective power in order to create systems transformation. Through the development of powerful strategic campaigns, we seek to expand the power of Black people across the Twin Cities metro area and Minnesota. This can look like delivering mobilization and action goals as part of a national coalition in which Black lives are centered, but it most often looks like visioning and leading targeted collaborative local campaigns that advance a concrete impact for peopleâ€™s lives here, while also advancing a shift in public narrative that connects to transformative long-term change.")
